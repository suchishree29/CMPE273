### What is psutil?

psutil (python system and process utilities) is a cross-platform library for retrieving information on running processes and system utilization (CPU, memory, disks, network) in Python

This code: 
 - Uses "psutil" and implements a network socket monitoring tool that can check the number of TCP sockets created by a web application.
 - Lists all processes that have any socket connections (meaning the laddr and raddr fields exist).
 - Groups them by PID and sorts the output by the number of the connections per process.
